# Running this example

Since we are now using multiple views - we'll need to use a server to serve our files
So first you'll need to make sure you have node & npm installed
#### Download Link

After successful installation run

`npm install`

After packages ( pushstate-server ) have been installed you can run 

`npm start`

This will start a http server on port 9000 in your current shell

Now visit: http://localhost:9000
